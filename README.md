# Cat Breed Classification
Authors: Sandy Tam, Christina Vo

### Description of Research Topic
This project will aim to answer the question of: how can we utilize convolutional neural netowrks to distinguish between different cat breeds using only image data and logistic regression to determine the cat breed as the output? By collecting, labeling, and training on a collected dataset, we will investigate what balance of dataset size, complexity, and generalization leads to the best performing model. We will analyze which visual features and data characteristics most influence model decisions.

### Project Outline
For our project outline, we will first search for our datasets, specifically looking for cat breed datasets containing images and characteristics. After having our datasets, we planned on testing the datasets with two models, CNN and Logistic Regression for two datasets to see which model would perform the best.

### Data Collection Plan
Sandy: I will find cat breed datasets from various sources including Kaggle. Then, I will build a core curated dataset and organize the data so they are consistent with one another.

Christina: When looking for cat breed datasets, there are two different data I want to look for. For one dataset, it would need to contain images in order to compare different cat breeds based on visuals. As for the other dataset, it would need to contain the different characteristics of cat breeds to find the relationships in order to identify the cat breed.

### Model Plans
Sandy: I plan to implement a simple CNN using PyTorch. The number of layers will vary, but I think I will aim to implement about 2 layers. I will experiment with various kernel sizes, activatoin functions, and optimizers to find the best performing model.

Christina: I plan on using a Logistic Regression model for the characteristics dataset as it can help in finding the relationships between features such as fur color, fur length, body weight, and other traits to identify the breed. I would test the data with train-test splitting and normalization to ensure that the model performs well.
