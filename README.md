# Cat Breed Classification using CNN
Authors: Sandy Tam, Christina Vo

### Description of Research Topic
This project will aim to answer the question of: how can we utilize convolutional neural netowrks to distinguish between different cat breeds using only image data? By collecting, labeling, and training on a collected dataset, we will investigate what balance of dataset size, complexity, and generalization leads to the best performing model. We will analyze which visual features most influence model decisions.

### Data Collection Plan
Sandy: I will find cat breed datasets from various sources including Kaggle. Then, I will build a core curated dataset and organize the data so they are consistent with one another.

### Model Plans
Sandy: I plan to implement a simple CNN using PyTorch. The number of layers will vary, but I think I will aim to implement about 2 layers. I will experiment with various kernel sizes, activatoin functions, and optimizers to find the best performing model.
